-THis time i was focusing on the sidebar part on every page. I did some research on how to beautify it and make it a design and layout that will fit on the background of the page. I was able to make a draft of it,means that i would still look for an improvement . I just want to put it there just to see the page. I still need to finalize it.
- Today, I just left behind the sidebar part because there is something important thing to do than this. I did first the employers registration page and login page and i updated the main page for registration which was the one that i made the previous day.All of them were just forms and dont have a database and they dont have functions.After i finished all the forms, i redirected them.
-To start off, i edited the login page. I did some adjustments.After a few minutes, i started to work on the latest job page. After the jobseeker had register and logged in,they will be redirected to this page which they can see the available jobs and the latest job posted by the employer. For this page,I put all the jobs on a table and make them clickable and at the bottom of it are the latest job posted but i was not able to finish it because i need to do more coding and especially more functions.I just left behind all the functions because i will just finish first all the html.
-This time, while i was reviewing all the html that i was already made. I noticed that this was something difficult to implement. It is the upload photo on the resume part of the jobseeker. I did some research first and trying to put them on my codes and after all the testing i made, it didnt work.

-Now i decided to started the php coding of all the html.  Yes, we are the one who have given a power to decide on what to do next for this project. Actually this project was not undergone a proper planning so thats why nahihirapan kami.So this time, i started to do a php functions for some of  the registration html page and after all the testing, it all works fine.

-Today i continue to finish all the registration database and functions.THen after a short time of debugging it, it was succeeded.Then i proceed to login functions and was not able to got it on my first testing of it.I will just continue it on the next day.

-I was still doing the login functions and still didnt get it.and after all the adjustments i did on my codes, it resulted me to get an error which is invalid perimeter. I search it first and got some possible solutions. I applied it to my codes and finally it worked.
- Today
